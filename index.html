	Roofs are designed to protect and make your lives comfortable within a specific structure. You surely know the roof color, the materials used to build it, and the importance of gutters. However, what do you know about roof flashing? Unbeknownst to many owners, this fixture is a vital part of the home’s shelter. Although it’s hardly noticeable because it sits quietly in the corners and junctions, it still plays a significant role. It directs the water flow away from critical areas of the roof and into the gutters. If not for roof flashing, water will be splashed all over the place!
